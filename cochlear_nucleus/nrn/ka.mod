TITLE klt.mod  The low threshold conductance of cochlear nucleus neurons

COMMENT

NEURON implementation of Jason Rothman's measurements of VCN conductances.

This file implements the transient potassium current found in ventral cochlear
nucleus "Type I" cells, which are largely "stellate" or "multipolar" cells  (Manis and
Marx, 1991; Rothman and Manis, 2003a,b; Manis et al, 1996). The current is likely
 mediated by Kv4.2 potassium channel subunits, but this has not been directly
demonstrated. The specific implementation is described in Rothman and Manis, J.
Neurophysiol. 2003, in the appendix. Measurements were made from isolated 
neurons from adult guinea pig, under reasonably stringent voltage clamp conditions.
 The measured current is sensitive to 4-aminopyridine. 
Original implementation by Paul B. Manis, April (JHU) and Sept, (UNC)1999.
